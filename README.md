## Basic User Registration

This project was developed during the course "Basic Programming in Back-End" given by Instituto SESI/SENAI of Santa Catarina/Brazil.

It uses JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js to create a mini non-relational database for user registration with Name, Login and Password.

Mongoose 6.11.5 was used during the development of this code, since version 7+ don't support callback in some function used.

<!--
# Node.js template

This is a Node.js project with an HTTP server.

Add your [configuration](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/learn/setting-up/tasks) to optimize it for [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io).

## How does this work?

We run `yarn start` to start an HTTP server that runs on http://localhost:8080. You can open new or existing devtools with the + button next to the devtool tabs.
